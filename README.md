# Linkedin Message Automation
> This linkendin automation script allows one to add links of linkedin profiles you want to connect to and the bot automatically logs in on your account and send provided message to connects and connects with them. Currently commands are passed with a list of dictionaries. This project uses selenium for web scraping and automation. I got the inspiration to work on this while working on my discord bot application [Discord Bot](https://github.com/devvspaces/discordbot). I learnt a lot about email services and seamless web automation while working on this project.
